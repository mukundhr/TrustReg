An investigator from the prosecutor's office informed the public that the applicant had committed these offenses. This directly undermines the presumption of innocence, which states that an individual is considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Publicly declaring guilt before a conviction, especially by an official representing the prosecution, is a serious breach of this principle.

The manner of the search and the treatment of the applicant within her own home appear disproportionate and intrusive.

Arbitrary detention is a violation of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to liberty and security of person.

This is a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial – not only should a judgment be rendered, but it should also be enforceable. The fact that the applicant has only received a fraction of the awarded amount over several years strongly suggests a failure to effectively enforce the court's decision.

**Explanation:**

The case details a protracted and unsuccessful attempt to evict a tenant from a flat in Rome. While the specific human rights law violated is not explicitly stated, the prolonged inability of the owners to regain possession of their property, despite obtaining court orders and multiple enforcement attempts, strongly suggests a violation of the right to property, which is protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The fact that the bailiff was unable to recover possession for over two years (between January 1990 and November 1991) due to the owner not being entitled to police assistance points to a systemic failure to uphold the legal rights of the property owners. This prolonged deprivation of possession, despite legal remedies being sought, could be considered an unjustifiable interference with their right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions.",0.5,0.375821053981781,0.5714285714285714,0.4,0.1879105269908905,0.1562341810124261,APPROVE,0,1,-0.5,1.0,0.3,0.4,0.0277984270847656,BLOCK,0,1,0,0.3,0.4,1.0,APPROVE,APPROVE,BLOCK

Here's why:

*   **Lack of Notice and Opportunity to be Heard:** Paragraph 12 describes a situation where the presiding magistrate changed the date of a hearing *after* Mrs. M. and her lawyer had left the courtroom. This resulted in Mrs. M. not being aware of the new date and therefore not being present at the hearing. The injunction was then issued in her absence. A fundamental principle of fair trial is the right to be heard and to present one's case. By changing the hearing date without notifying Mrs. M. or her legal representative, she was denied this opportunity.

This implies that the legal system acknowledged their detention might have been unjustified and provided a mechanism for compensation. The fact that they received non-pecuniary compensation further supports this.

*   **Denial of Purchase Rights:** The applicants were employees who moved into flats as part of their employment. The 1991 Act provided a legal framework for the sale of such flats to occupiers under favorable conditions. The applicants' attempts to purchase their flats after this law was enacted were refused. This suggests a denial of a right that was legally established or intended to be available.
*   **Eviction Proceedings:** Mlini Hotels initiated eviction proceedings against the applicants. If the applicants had a legitimate basis for occupying the flats (such as a protected tenancy which they sought to have recognized), then being subjected to eviction proceedings without due process or a proper resolution of their claims could constitute a violation.

Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) protects the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions.

The inheritance proceedings were concluded in 1962, but the Regional Court only quashed that decision in 1995, a gap of 33 years. The district court then discontinued proceedings in 1998, and the Regional Court quashed that decision in 1999. This prolonged legal process, spanning decades, could potentially raise concerns about the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. Many human rights instruments, like Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), guarantee the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time.

*   **Suppression of rights:** Were individuals prevented from speaking their preferred language, practicing their culture, or accessing services in their language?

While the applicant's specific injuries are not detailed in relation to the operation itself, the overall casualty count suggests a high level of violence. The statement that the applicant ""showed resistance"" doesn't automatically justify potentially excessive force.

Here's the reasoning:

*   **Right to Property (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights):** The applicant entered into a contract with the bank for a deposit account with a specific interest rate of 190% per annum for ten years. This contract created a legitimate expectation and a form of property for the applicant and her granddaughter.

This eastern region, now known as Transdniestria, had since 1924, together with a number of territories which are now part of Ukraine, been part of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The population of Transdniestria was originally composed principally of Ukrainians and Moldovans/Romanians, but from the 1920s onwards it was subject to significant immigration by industrial workers from elsewhere in the Soviet Union, particularly Russians and Ukrainians. In a census organised by the Soviet Union in 1989, the population of Transdniestria was assessed at 679,000, composed ethnically and linguistically of 40% Moldovan, 28% Ukrainian, 24% Russian and 8% others.', '9.

Here's why:

*   **Right to Property:** The case describes the expropriation of the applicants' flat for state needs. While states can expropriate property, this right is not absolute and is subject to strict conditions under human rights law, particularly Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights (and similar provisions in other international human rights instruments).
*   **Adequate Compensation:** A key condition for lawful expropriation is that the owner receives ""prompt and adequate compensation."" The case states that the market value of the flat was found to be USD 16,350. However, the sentence abruptly ends with ""An additional sum of USD 12,6"". If this indicates that the compensation offered was less than the market value or was otherwise inadequate, it would constitute a violation.

*   **Right to a fair trial:** A fundamental aspect of a fair trial is that it must be conducted by a lawfully appointed and independent judge. If the judge's appointment was invalid, then the proceedings before them might not have been lawful, thus violating the right to a fair trial.

If these statements were obtained without the benefit of legal advice, their admissibility in court could be challenged as being obtained unfairly.

The prolonged delay in bringing charges or conducting investigations raises questions about the necessity and proportionality of his detention. The grounds for detention mentioned in paragraph 7 (suspicion of a serious offense, risk of absconding, and obstructing investigation) need to be assessed against the evidence and the passage of time.

It noted that in the Government ruling no. 239 (see Relevant domestic law and practice part below) the area where the plot was located was designated as a forest of national importance. Given that such forests were to be bought out by the State, in accordance with Article 13 of the Law on the Restoration of the Rights of Ownership of Citizens to Existing Real Property enacted in 1997 (hereinafter “the Law on Restitution”), there was no legal basis to grant the applicant’s action.

*   **The Case Focuses on Domestic Law and Property Rights:** The case details a dispute over the restitution of property rights based on Lithuanian domestic law (specifically, the Law on the Restoration of the Rights of Ownership of Citizens to Existing Real Property). The court's decision hinges on the interpretation of these domestic laws and government rulings.

*   **No Direct Mention of Human Rights:** The text does not explicitly mention any human rights conventions, treaties, or articles being violated. The applicant is seeking restitution of property rights, which can be a component of human rights (like the right to property), but the violation itself isn't stated.
